This project focuses on visualizing synaptic connections between neurons, with a particular focus on the Presynapse (axon side) and Postsynapse (dendritic side).

Description
Presynapse: Represents the axon side of the synapse, where connections are made with other neurons.
Postsynapse: Represents the dendritic side of the synapse, where signals are received from other neurons.
Each synapse is characterized by its position (three-dimensional coordinates), name, and size.

The goal of this project is to map these synapses in 3D space to better understand their distribution and interactions.
